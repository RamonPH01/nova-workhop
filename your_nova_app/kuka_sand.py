"""
Sanding an even (flat) bar with a virtual KUKA KR16 R2010 robot.

The motion imitates hand sanding:
- Approach the bar perpendicular to its surface and touch down gently
- Stroke back and forth along the bar in straight lines
- Lift off and return home

The start (home) position is the taught "home" pose of the flange in world
coordinates; the TCP "1" is the Sander, as configured on the robot controller.

Geometry (world coordinates, robot base on the table at the origin):
- The center of the sanding area is at (`surface_x`, `surface_y`, `surface_z`)
- The bar axis is turned by `bar_yaw_deg` about the world z-axis
  (0 = along the world x-axis, away from the robot; 90 = along the world y-axis)
- The face is tilted by `tilt_deg` about the bar axis (0 = horizontal, facing up)
- The sanding disc is the robot's TCP "1" (the Sander) and is tilted by
  `pad_angle_deg` against the surface across the bar
  (like a hand-held disc sander; this also keeps the robot wrist out of
  singularities)
